AV Evasion Categories:
- On-disk
- In-memory

### On-Disk Evasion

1. Packers (outdated) - Compresses executable without altering functionality.
2. Obfuscators - Mutates code by inserting dead code, irrelevant functions, splitting and reordering, etc.
3. Crypter (most effective) - Encrypts code and decrypts in-memory

### In-Memory Evasion

1. Remote Process Memory Injection - Injects payload into a benign valid PE
	1. Obtain valid HANDLE to target process using OpenProcess function
	2. Allocate memory to target process with VirtualAllocEx
	3. Copy payload to allocated memory with WriteProcessMemory
	4. Execute payload in memory with CreateRemoteThread
2. Reflected DLL Injection - Load DLL in process memory. Attackers must create their own APIs to do this.
3. Process Hollowing/ Inline hooking - modifies memory and introduces a hook that redirects code execution to our payload to execute. Once executed, the original function resumes.
	1. Rootkits use hooking
