Vulnerability scanning is the process of identifying the attack surface of a software, system, or network.

Process of vulnerability scan
1. Host discovery
2. Port scanning
3. Operating system, service, and version detection
4. Matching the results to a vulnerability database
	1. [_National Vulnerability Database_](https://nvd.nist.gov/) and the [_Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures_](https://cve.mitre.org/cve/search_cve_list.html) (CVE) program

Each CVE has a CVSS score

### Types of Vulnerability Scans 

**External** - Analyze systems publicly accessible from the internet (ex: web apps, systems in the DMZ, etc.) to find externally exposed systems or services the client may not be aware of. 

**Internal** - Scan systems on-site or with VPN access to get overview of security status of internal network. 

**Unauthenticated** - Scan system without credentials to find vulnerabilities in remotely accessible services (ex: open ports)

**Authenticated** - Scan system with credentials (privileged account) to check for vulnerable packages, missing patches, or configuration vulnerabilities. 

### Considerations for Vulnerability Scans 

**Duration** - External scans over the internet can be time consuming with several IPs

**Target Visibility** - Will firewalls or other access restrictions render systems and services inaccessible

**Rate Limiting** - When scan exceeds thresholds like throughput, packet count, connection count, we will be limited in our networking capabilities. Scanner may miss live hosts or services. 

**Network and Service Impact** - Scan produces lots of network traffic which can render network unusable. Potential solution is to reduce the number of parallel scans and scanning speed.
