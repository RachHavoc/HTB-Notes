### Linux File Permissions Recap

```
kali@kali:~$ ls -l /etc/shadow
-rw-r----- 1 root shadow 1751 May  2 09:31 /etc/shadow
```

- First hyphen: `-` - filetype 
- Next three characters `rw-` - File owner permissions
- Next `r - -`- Group owner permissions
- Next `---`- Others group has no permissions

### Manual Enumeration

1. Get info about current user
	`id`
2. Enumerate all users
    `cat /etc/passwd`
3. Hostname
    `hostname`
4. OS Release and Kernel Version and Architecture
   `cat /etc/issue`
   `cat /etc/os-release`
   `uname -a`
5. Running processes and services
   `ps aux`
6. Network interfaces & TCP/IP Configs
   `ip a`
7. Routing tables
   `routel`
   `route`
8. Active network connections and listening ports 
	`netstat`
	`ss -anp`
9. Firewall rules
	`cat /etc/iptables/rules.v4`
10. Scheduled Tasks
	`ls -lah /etc/cron*`
	`sudo crontab -l`
11. Installed applications
	`dpkg -l`
12. Insecure File and Directory Permissions
	`find / -writable -type d 2>/dev/null`
13. Mounted filesystems and drives that mount at boot time
	`mount`
	`cat /etc/fstab`
14. View available disks - to reveal unmounted partitions because we may be able to mount the partitions and search for interesting files (credentials, priv esc vectors, persistence) 
	`lsblk`
15. Device drivers and kernel modules
    `lsmod`
	`/sbin/modinfo <driver name>`- get more info about specific driver

### Priv Esc Shortcuts

#### SUID Permissions
If SETUID and SETGID permissions are set on a file, then the current user can execute the file with the rights of the owner (setuid) or the rights of the group (setgid)

Search for SUID binaries:
`find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null`

### Automated Enumeration

Tools:
- [LinEnum](https://github.com/rebootuser/LinEnum)
- [LinPEAS](https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/tree/master/linPEAS)
- [Unix-Priv-Esc-Check](http://pentestmonkey.net/tools/audit/unix-privesc-check)

Tool Demo: `unix-privesc-check`

```hlt:4
kali@kali:~$ unix-privesc-check
unix-privesc-check v1.4 ( http://pentestmonkey.net/tools/unix-privesc-check )

Usage: unix-privesc-check { standard | detailed }

"standard" mode: Speed-optimised check of lots of security settings.

"detailed" mode: Same as standard mode, but also checks perms of open file
                 handles and called files (e.g. parsed from shell scripts,
                 linked .so files).  This mode is slow and prone to false 
                 positives but might help you find more subtle flaws in 3rd
                 party programs.

This script checks file permissions and other settings that could allow
local users to escalate privileges.
...
```

Transfer this script to target machine and execute in "standard" mode 

```
joe@debian-privesc:~$ ./unix-privesc-check standard > output.txt
```
